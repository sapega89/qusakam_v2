## 🎨 Aesthetic Guide: "Sphere 1" (Sfera: Odin) Vibe

To achieve the look and feel of the classic 2003 RPG "Sphere":

### 1. 🌫️ Fog & Atmosphere
- Use a **CanvasModulate** node with a desaturated tint (e.g., `#B0B5BB`).
- Add a **WorldEnvironment** with `Glow` enabled. Set `Bloom` to 0.1-0.2 for that "old-school dreamy" highlight.

### 2. 🟫 Desaturated Palette
- Avoid saturated colors. Canyon should be dusty grey-orange, and the Laboratory should be cold cyan-grey.

### 3. 🖼️ Parallax Horizons
- "Sphere" emphasized vast, lonely spaces. Ensure your backgrounds have at least 3 layers:
  - **Foreground**: High detail, dark silhouettes.
  - **Middle**: Foggy hills.
  - **Background**: Distant mountains or the sky, almost white/faded.

### 4. 🕍 Gothic Architecture
- Use sharp, vertical lines for buildings. Stone textures should look weathered and gritty.

### 5. 🎞️ Vignette Shader
- Adding a subtle dark vignette to the corners of the screen helps focus the eye on the character, mimicking early 3D RPG camera limits.
